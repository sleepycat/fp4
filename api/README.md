# Backend API

## Policy Drivers

* In the Government of Canada [APIs are mandatory](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/policies-standards/government-canada-enterprise-architecture-framework.html#toc04:~:text=expose%20services%2C%20including%20existing%20ones%2C%20through%20APIs).
* Departments are required to [consume the APIs they build](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/government-canada-standards-apis.html#:~:text=Consume%20what%20you%20build) in order to validate the API is usable.

## Architectural Decisions

### Using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org)

While The TBS Standard on APIs says that APIs should use REST "[by default](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/government-canada-standards-apis.html#:~:text=APIs%20must%20follow%20the%20RESTful%20model%20by%20default.)".
Here we are exercising the latitude to go beyond the default (it's been confirmed with TBS this is allowed) and use GraphQL because [it allows for composition](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/federated-types/composition/). Services built with composition in mind turn themselves into building blocks that can be combined in various ways to allow the organization as a whole to quickly adapt to shifting demands (hence calls for a "[composable enterprise](https://www.gartner.com/en/doc/465932-future-of-applications-delivering-the-composable-enterprise)").

GraphQL's design aligns with [published patterns for secure input handling](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_spring17_08_bratus.pdf).
These design patterns (like the "recognizer pattern" and GraphQL implementation diagram below) are normally only used by defense contractors and security companies, requiring custom parser development, sophisticated developers and big budgets.

Having these patterns appear in a relatively mainstream technology creates an opportunity to democratize these patterns.
By adopting GraphQL along with some opinionated usage patterns, it should be possible to build APIs that function like a [cross-domain solution](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/defence/nationalsecurity/sensitive-technology-list.html#:~:text=Cross%20domain%20solutions,from%20connected%20networks.), something this project is hoping to pioneer.

### Using Javascript

The selection of JavaScript as the implementation language serves a few purposes:
* Smaller team size: [Once considered mythical](https://frontendmasters.com/guides/front-end-handbook/2017/practice/myth.html#:~:text=given%20that%20JavaScript%20has%20infiltrated%20all%20layers%20of%20a%20technology%20stack%20(e.g.%20React%2C%20node.js%2C%20express%2C%20couchDB%2C%20gulp.js%20etc...)%20finding%20a%20full%2Dstack%20JS%20developer%20who%20can%20code%20the%20front%2Dend%20and%20back%2Dend%20is%20becoming%20less%20mythical.%20Typically%2C%20these%20full%20stack%20developers%20only%20deal%20with%20JavaScript.), full stack development is achievable wherever you can use a single language for both frontend and backend. This allows for smaller, more agile teams.
* Lower risk: The use of memory safe languages represents a [significant risk reduction](https://www.memorysafety.org/docs/memory-safety/#how-common-are-memory-safety-vulnerabilities), and even among memory safe languages [JavaScript compares favourably](https://securityflawheatmap.veracode.com/p/1).
* Modern security features: New JavaScript runtimes are pioneering new security features. This API is built with [Deno](https://deno.com/), which [sandboxes code by default](https://deno.com/blog/deno-protects-npm-exploits#secure-by-default) to protect against supply-chain attacks and other hacks. These security features are not yet built into other languages.

### Using Sqlite

This API is assumed to be a read-heavy workload with low-to-no concurrent writes. This usage profile allows the use of [Sqlite for a simple, operations-free database](https://dev.to/shayy/everyone-is-wrong-about-sqlite-4gjf).

## Debugging Notifications

Sometimes it's tricky to figure out how to get a notification sent via notify. Sending a few with `curl` can help clarify what is going on since the [node client](https://docs.notifications.service.gov.uk/node.html#node-js-client-documentation) is simply a wrapper around the [REST API](https://documentation.notification.canada.ca/en/start.html).
This is an example of how use curl
```sh
curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
 -H 'Authorization: ApiKey-v1 gcntfy-my_test_key-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX' \
 -d '{"template_id":"XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX","email_address":"test@example.com","personalisation":{"myvariable":"foo"}}' \
 'https://api.notification.canada.ca/v2/notifications/email'
```
